# Holling functional feeding relationship

# ingestion rate from estimation
# combine availability * selectivtiy = vulnerability
# depth + spatial overlap
# size vulnerability (weigth predator preference and prey vulnerability according to respective survivorship curves & size-age relationships)
# can add seasonal vulnerability to account for whales, reproductive season in colonies etc.


# preferences or diet restrictions according to habitat dependencies: ice, krill, land, shelf etc.

****************************************
# metabolism

# should there be consideration of increased metabolic effort at lower consumption levels.


****************************************
# Mortality

# consider how mortality alters the survivorship curve 

# use recruitment models to alter the life-time reproductive success and therefore impacts on recruitment e.g. emperor penguin chick mortality, land-based chick/pup mortality etc.

****************************************
# Carcass pool will have altered C:Fe composition depending on what is contributing to it.
