Composition of diet is a product of a predator's foraging behaviour, type of prey capture and handling, the availability of prey relative to the predator, and the preferences of the predator given a selection of alternative prey.  The dynamics of predators to prey is simplified in dynamic models using some form of functional response (Koen-Alonso & Yodzis, 2005).  For the purposes of assessing stable states, a multispecies Type II functional response will be adequate, particularly when it has been found to perform well in modelling the dynamics of marine food webs (Koen-Alonso & Yodzis, 2005).  The per biomass consumption of prey, i, by predator, j, is:  
  
$$
F_{ij}=\frac {\hat{I}_{ij}\hat{v}_{ij}B_i}{\hat{I}_{ij}+\sum_{i'}\hat{v}_{i'j}B_{i'}}
$$

Here, vulnerability, $\hat{v}$, combines the degree of overlap of the distributions of predator and prey with selectivity, as in size models or forms of preference.  The functional relationship then describes the probability of capture of an individual prey by an individual predator given the abundance and vulnerabilities of all prey.  Where overlap of prey with a predator is not 100% then this functional form will approximate a Type III relationship.

Importantly, vulnerability is not the same as a diet matrix developed from analyses of the diet of predators.  This is because the observed diet is the result of the combined vulnerabilities and densities of prey coupled with any competitive interactions between predators that may occur.  

How can a vulnerability matrix of prey to predators be realistically approximated, particularly when a biomass pool may encompass a variety of sizes of organisms with different spatial distributions and behaviours?

The component of vulnerability relating to overlap is straight forward to accommodate using probabilities of being found in different areas or depths.  For a pool comprising taxa with different distributions, the proportion of the biomass of the pool expected to be found in a place provides the foundation for assessing overlap.  

Selectivity is more difficult  
In size-based models, the probabilit





Vulnerability of prey may change when some prey age classes become more or less exposed to predation. Unpacking $\hat{v}$ gives

$$
\hat{v}_{ij}B_i=v(a0)_{ij}w(a0)_ir_i\sum_{a}{mN_a}+\sum_a{v(a)_{i,j} N_a w_a}
$$
*r* is the per adult reproductive success to age zero, *a0*,  *m* is a maturity ogive.  
  Incorporating age specific vulnerabilities requires solving for age-specific mortality rates if weight at age varies greatly.  If adult weight does not vary with age and vulnerability is approximately constant for adults then the equation is easily simplified to solve for changes in either juvenile or adult vulnerabilities and the general vulnerability of the biomass is independent of the age-specific mortality rates, such that:

$$
\hat{v}_{ij}=\frac{v_{ij}(a0)w_i(a0)+ v_{ij}(a)\bar{w}_i(a)}{(r_iw_i(a0)+\bar{w}_i(a))}
$$
